Finally, aim to sharpen your skills. Your data science journey will be full of constant learning, but there are advanced courses you can complete to ensure you’ve covered all the bases.

You’ll want to be comfortable with regression, classification, and k-means clustering models. You can also step into machine learning – bootstrapping models and creating neural networks using scikit-learn.

At this point, programming projects can include creating models using live data feeds. Machine learning models of this kind adjust their predictions over time.
